Ingredients:
- 12oz your favorite milk
- 2 tablespoons of nestle chocolate milk powder
- A decent working microwave

Directions:
1. Pour milk into your favorite large mug/cup.

2. Place your mug in your microwave.

3. Heat for about 1-2.5 minutes depending on your microwave strength. I'd start at 1 minute then work your way up just in case.

4. Remove from microwave and stir in your nestle chocolate milk powder.

5. Enjoy!
